# Developer Guide

## Windows

Before building, run the environment checker from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\checkEnvironment.ps1
```

It verifies the JDK, native compiler, Vulkan shader tools, DLSS SDK files,
hardware information, and free disk space without changing the system. Add
`-IncludeCacheSizes` to report the size of disposable Gradle, build, and
Minecraft run data:

```powershell
.\checkEnvironment.ps1 -IncludeCacheSizes
```

1. Install the Vulkan SDK from <https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home>.
   The installer sets `VULKAN_SDK` automatically.
2. Download the DLSS SDK from <https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/releases>.
   Extract it, then set `DLSS_SDK` to the folder you extracted.

   To set it permanently for your Windows user account, run PowerShell with:

   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DLSS_SDK", "C:\path\to\dlss-sdk", "User")
   ```

   Restart your terminal after setting it. To set it only for the current
   PowerShell session, use:

   ```powershell
   $env:DLSS_SDK = "C:\path\to\dlss-sdk"
   ```

3. Configure and build the native shim:

```powershell
.\buildNative.ps1
```

   The script accepts `VULKAN_SDK` and `DLSS_SDK` when they are set. It also
   recognizes the default personal Codex toolchain layout:
   `Documents\Codex\Toolchains\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0` and
   `Documents\Codex\Toolchains\DLSS`.

4. Run the client. This also performs an incremental native shim build, so it
   is the only command normally needed after initial setup:

```powershell
.\runClient.ps1
```

## Linux

Set `DLSS_SDK` and `VULKAN_SDK` before configuring CMake:

```bash
export DLSS_SDK=/path/to/dlss-sdk
export VULKAN_SDK=/path/to/vulkan-sdk
```

`DLSS_SDK` must contain the NGX headers and static library. `VULKAN_SDK` must
contain Vulkan headers.

Then configure and build the native shim:

```bash
cmake -S native/ngx_shim -B build/cmake/ngx_shim/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/cmake/ngx_shim/release
```

On NixOS, enter the development shell from `flake.nix` instead of setting up
the toolchain by hand:

```bash
nix develop
cmake -S native/ngx_shim -B build/cmake/ngx_shim/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/cmake/ngx_shim/release
```

## Native Bundling

Gradle bundles NGX natives for the current host platform by default:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Release builds that already have both platform shims available can request a
cross-platform native bundle:

```bash
./gradlew build -PngxPlatforms=windows-x64,linux-x64
```

Run the Vulkan RT/DLSS-RR client with:

```bash
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS='-Xmx8G -XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:+UseZGC' nvidia-offload ./gradlew runClient --args='--renderDebugLabels --graphicsBackend VULKAN'
```
